  `REAEME.md` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Jul-22-2021: Version 2.0.0

This is a major version release. There are some backword-incompatible changes.

1. Grid point indexing system to address grid points of q-points is changed.
2. Array data types of most of the integer arrays are changed to `dtype='int_'`
   from `dtype='intc'`.
3. Python 3.5 or later is required.

To emulate the version 1.x behaviour in `phono3py` command, try `--v1` option.
To emurate the version 1.x behaviour in API, specify `store_dense_gp_map=False`
and `store_dense_svecs=False` in instatiation of `Phono3py` class or phon3py
loader.

## Mar-17-2021: Version 1.22.3

- Fix `--read-gamma` option to work.

## Feb-21-2021: Version 1.22.2

- Fix PyPI source distribution package

## Feb-21-2021: Version 1.22.1

- `phono3py` command didn't work. This was fixed.
- Fix behaviour when specifying `--thm` and `--sigma` simultaneously.

## Jan-29-2021: Version 1.22.0

- Maintenance release to follow phonopy v2.9.0.

## Sep-30-2020: Version 1.21.0

- Maintenance release to follow the change of phonopy at v2.8.1
- Improvements of phono3py loader (`phono3py.load`), `phono3py-load` command,
  API, and `phono3py_disp.yaml`.
- Harmonic phonon calculation on mesh was multithreaded. This is effective when
  using very dense mesh with non-analytical term correction (probably rare
  case).
- Real and imaginary parts of self energy and spectral function of bubble
  diagram at API level

## Mar-3-2020: Version 1.20.0

- `phono3py_disp.yaml` is made when creating displacements in addition to
  `disp_fc3.yaml` and `disp_fc2.yaml`. `phono3py_disp.yaml` will be used instead
  of `disp_fc3.yaml` and `disp_fc2.yaml` in the future major release (v2.0).

## Mar-3-2020: Version 1.19.1

- Release for pypi and conda (atztogo channel) packagings

## Mar-2-2020: Version 1.19.0

- Improvements of phono3py loader and API.
- Improvement of interfaces to calculators. Now it is expected to be much easier
  to implement calculator interface if it exists in phonopy.
- Fixed dependency to phonopy v2.6.0.

## Dec-22-2019: Version 1.18.2

- Initial version of phono3py loader (`phono3py.load`) was implemented. See
  docstring of `phono3py.load`.

## Oct-17-2019: Version 1.18.1

- Fix of phono3py-kaccum to follow the latest phonopy.

## Oct-9-2019: Version 1.18.0

- Maintenance release

## Apr-18-2019: Version 1.17.0

- `--cfz` option was made to subtract residual forces. See {ref}`cfz_option`.
- `--cutoff-pair` was made to override the cutoff pair distance written in
  `disp_fc3.yaml` when using on calculating force constants. This is useful when
  checking cutoff distance dependency. So the use case of having fully computed
  `FORCES_FC3` is assumed.
- TURBOMOLE interface is provided by Antti Karttunen (`--turbomole`).
- Compatibility of `fc2.hdf5` and `force_constants.hdf5` was improved for all
  calculators to store physical unit information in the hdf5 file. See
  {ref}`file_format_compatibility`.

## Mar-24-2019: Version 1.16.0

- Bug fixes and catching up the updates of phonopy.
- Most of hdf5 output files are compressed by `gzip` as default. This
  compression can be set off, see {ref}`hdf5_compression_option`.
- (Experimental) `phono3py` command accepts `phono3py.yaml` type file as an
  input crystal structure by `-c` option. When `DIM` and any structure file are
  not given, `phono3py_disp.yaml` (primary) or `phono3py.yaml` (secondary) is
  searched in the current directory. Then `phono3py.yaml` type file is used as
  the input. By this, semi-automatic phono3py mode is invocked, which acts as

  1. `supercell_matrix` corresponding to `DIM` in the `phono3py.yaml` type file
     is used if it exists.
  2. `phonon_supercell_matrix` corresponding to `DIM_FC2` in the `phono3py.yaml`
     type file is used if it exists.
  3. `primitive_matrix` in the `phono3py.yaml` type file is used if it exists.
     Otherwise, set `PRIMITIVE_AXES = AUTO` when `PRIMITIVE_AXES` is not given.
  4. NAC params are read (`NAC = .TRUE.`) if NAC params are contained (primary)
     in the `phono3py.yaml` type file or if `BORN` file exists in the current
     directory (secondary).

## Nov-22-2018: version 1.14.3

- Update to work with phonopy v1.14.2.
- Ph-ph interaction can be read (`--read-pp`) and write (`--write-pp`) in RTA
  thermal conductivity calculation, too. Mind that the data stored are different
  with and without `--full-pp`. Wihtout `--full-pp` the data are stored in
  complicated way to save data side, so it is not considered readable by usual
  users.

## June-20-2018: version 1.13.3

- `--lw` (linewidth) option was removed. Use `--br` option and find 2\*gamma
  values as linewidths in `kappa-xxx.hdf5` file.
- Documentation of `--lbte` option is available at {ref}`direct_solution`.
- This version is dependent on phonopy>=1.13.2.

## May-17-2018: version 1.13.1

- Compact force constants are implemented (See {ref}`compact_fc_option`).

## Mar-16-2018: version 1.12.9

- Definition of `mode_kappa` values in output hdf5 file is changed. Previously
  they were divided by number of grid points, but now not. Therefore users who
  compute `kappa` from `mode_kappa` need to be careful about this change. This
  does not affect to `phono3py-kaccum` results.

## Feb-1-2018: version 1.12.7

- `--tsym` option is removed. Now with `--sym-fc3r` and `--sym-fc2` options,
  translational invariance symmetry is also applied.
- `--sym-fc` option is added. This is just an alias to specify both `--sym-fc3r`
  and `--sym-fc2` together.
- Documentation on `--write-phonon` and `--read-phonon` options is written.
  These options are used to save harmonic phonon infromation on strage.

## Nov-22-2017: version 1.12.5

- Bug fix of RTA thermal conductivity. This bug exists from version 1.10.11.18
  (git e40cd059). This bug exhibits when all the following conditions are met:

  1. RTA thermal conductivity calculation.
  2. Tetrahedron method for Brillouin zone integration is used.
  3. Number of triplets is smaller than number of bands at each grid point.
  4. Without using `--full-pp`.

  (3) happens when the primitive cell is relatively large. Number of triplets
  can be shown using `--stp` option. A race condition of OpenMP multithreading
  is the source of the bug. Therefore, if it occurs, the same calculation comes
  up with the different thermal conductivity value in every run time, for whcih
  it behaves like randomly.

- RTA thermal conductivity with smearing method (`--sigma`) is made to run with
  smaller memory consumption as similar as tetrahedron method (`--thm`).

## Nov-17-2017: version 1.12.3

- Command option parser of the phonopy tools is replaced from `optparse` to
  `argparse`.
- The filenames used with these options were the positional arguments
  previously. Now they are the command-line arguments, i.e., filenames have to
  be put just after the option name like
  `-f vasprun.xml-001 vasprun.xml-002 ...`.
- The names of auxiliary tools (`kdeplot` and `kaccum`) are changed, for which
  the prefix phono3py- is added to the old names to avoid accidental conflict
  with other script names already existing under bin directory.
- {ref}`sigma_cutoff_option` option was created.

## Jun-18-2017: version 1.11.13

- {ref}`normal_umklapp_option` option was made.
- Many minor updates: fixing bugs, improving usabilities.
- Improve of {ref}`auxiliary_tools_kaccum` and {ref}`auxiliary_tools_kdeplot`.

## Mar-31-2017: version 1.11.11

- Abinit code interface is implemented and now under the testing.
- Reduction of memory usage in RTA thermal conductivity calculation. This is
  especially effective for larger unit cell case. Currently combinations with
  --full_pp, --write_gamma_detail, and --simga(smearing method) are not
  supported for this. Performance tuning is under going. In some case,
  computation can be slower than the previous versions.

## Feb-9-2017: version 1.11.9

- This version works coupled with phonopy-1.11.8 or later.
- CRYSTAL code interface is implemented by Antti J. Karttunen.

## Dec-14-2016: version 1.11.7

- This is a maintenance release. This version must be used with phonopy-1.11.6
  or later.

## Nov-27-2016: version 1.11.5

- `gaccum` is merged to `kaccum`. `gaccum` is removed. See
  {ref}`auxiliary_tools_kaccum`.
- `kdeplot` is added. See {ref}`auxiliary_tools_kdeplot`.

## Apr-24-2016: version 1.10.9

- Failure of writing `kappa-mxxx-gx.hdf5` was fixed.

## Apr-16-2016: version 1.10.7

- API example is prepared and it is found in `Si` example. No doucment yet.
- Si pwscf example was placed in `example-phono3py` directory.
- User interface bug fix.

## Mar-15-2016: version 1.10.5

- Numbering way of phono3py version was just changed (No big updates were made
  against previous version.) The number is given based on the phonopy version.
  For example, the harmonic part of phono3py-1.10.5 is based on the code close
  to phonopy-1.10.4.
- Python3 support
- For the RTA thermal conductivity calculation mode with using the linear
  tetrahedron method, only necessary part of phonon-phonon interaction strengh
  among phonons. This improves lifetime calculation performance, but as the
  drawback, averaged ph-ph interaction strength can not be given. See
  {ref}`full_pp_option`.
- Pwscf interface ({ref}`calculator_interfaces`)

## Oct-10-2015: version 0.9.14

- Computational performance tuning for phonon-phonon interaction strength
  calculation was made by Jonathan Skelton. Depending on systems, but 10-20%
  performance improvement may be possible.
- `--stp` option is created to show numbers of q-point triplets to be
  calculated. See {ref}`command_options`.
- `--write_gamma` and `--read_gamma` support using with `--bi` option. Therefore
  a thermal conductivity calculation can be distributed over band index, too.
  This may be useful for the system whose unit cell is large.

## Sep-26-2015: version 0.9.13

- Changed so that `--wgp` option writes `grid_address-mxxx.hdf5` instead of
  `grid_address-mxxx.dat`.
- `--write_detailed_gamma` is implemented. See {ref}`command_options`.
- When running without setting `--thm` and `--sigma` options, linear tetrahedron
  method corresponding to `--thm` is used as the default behavior.
- `--ise` options is created.

## Aug-12-2015: version 0.9.12

- Spglib update to version 1.8.2.1.
- Improve computational performance of `kaccum` and `gaccum`.

## Jun-18-2015: version 0.9.10.1

- Bug fix of `gcaccum`

## Jun-17-2015: version 0.9.10

- Fix bug in `kaccum`. When using with `--pa` option, irreducible q-points were
  incorrectly indexed.
- `gaccum` is implemented. `gaccum` is very similar to `kaccum`, but for
  $\Gamma_\lambda(\omega_\lambda)$.
- spglib update.

## Changes in version 0.9.7

- The definition of MSPP is modified so as to be averaged ph-ph interaction
  defined as $P_{\mathbf{q}j}$ in the arXiv manuscript. The key in the kappa
  hdf5 file is changed from `mspp` to `ave_pp`. The physical unit of
  $P_{\mathbf{q}j}$ is set to $\text{eV}^2$.

## Changes in version 0.9.6

- Silicon example is put in `example-phono3py` directory.
- Accumulated lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by `kaccum` script.
- JDOS output format was changed.

## Changes in version 0.9.5

- In `kappa-xxx.hdf5` file, `heat_capacity` format was changed from
  `(irreducible q-point, temperature, phonon band)` to
  `(temperature, irreducible q-point, phonon band)`. For `gamma`, previous
  document was wrong in the array shape. It is
  `(temperature, irreducible q-point, phonon band)`

## Changes in version 0.9.4

- The option of `--cutoff_mfp` is renamed to `--boundary_mfp` and now it's on
  the document.
- Detailed contribution of `kappa` at each **q**-point and phonon mode is output
  to .hdf5 with the keyword `mode_kappa`.

## Changes in version 0.8.11

- A new option of `--cutoff_mfp` for including effective boundary mean free
  path.
- The option name `--cutfc3` is changed to `--cutoff_fc3`.
- The option name `--cutpair` is changed to `--cutoff_pair`.
- A new option `--ga` is created.
- Fix spectrum plot of joint dos and imaginary part of self energy

## Changes in version 0.8.10

- Different supercell size of fc2 from fc3 can be specified using `--dim_fc2`
  option.
- `--isotope` option is implemented. This is used instead of `--mass_variances`
  option without specifying the values. Mass variance parameters are read from
  database.

## Changes in version 0.8.2

- Phono3py python interface is rewritten and a lot of changes are introduced.
- `FORCES_SECOND` and `FORCES_THIRD` are no more used. Instead just one file of
  `FORCES_FC3` is used. Now `FORCES_FC3` is generated by `--cf3` option and the
  backward compatibility is simple:
  `cat FORCES_SECOND FORCES_THIRD > FORCES_FC3`.
- `--multiple_sigmas` is removed. The same behavior is achieved by `--sigma`.

## Changes in version 0.8.0

- `--q_direction` didn't work. Fix it.
- Implementation of tetrahedron method whcih is activated by `--thm`.
- Grid addresses are written out by `--wgp` option.

## Changes in version 0.7.6

- Cut-off distance for fc3 is implemented. This is activated by `--cutfc3`
  option. FC3 elements where any atomic pair has larger distance than cut-off
  distance are set zero.
- `--cutpair` works only when creating displacements. The cut-off pair distance
  is written into `disp_fc3.yaml` and FC3 is created from `FORCES_THIRD` with
  this information. Usually sets of pair displacements are more redundant than
  that needed for creating fc3 if index permutation symmetry is considered.
  Therefore using index permutation symmetry, some elements of fc3 can be
  recovered even if some of supercell force calculations are missing. In
  paticular, all pair distances among triplet atoms are larger than cutoff pair
  distance, any fc3 elements are not recovered, i.e., the element will be zero.

## Changes in version 0.7.2

- Default displacement distance is changed to 0.03.
- Files names of displacement supercells now have 5 digits numbering,
  `POSCAR-xxxxx`.
- Cutoff distance between pair displacements is implemented. This is triggered
  by `--cutpair` option. This option works only for calculating atomic forces in
  supercells with configurations of pairs of displacements.

## Changes in version 0.7.1

- It is changed to sampling q-points in Brillouin zone. Previously q-points are
  sampled in reciprocal primitive lattice. Usually this change affects very
  little to the result.
- q-points of phonon triplets are more carefully sampled when a q-point is on
  Brillouin zone boundary. Usually this change affects very little to the
  result.
- Isotope effect to thermal conductivity is included.

## Changes in version 0.6.0

- `disp.yaml` is renamed to `disp_fc3.yaml`. Old calculations with `disp.yaml`
  can be used without any problem just by changing the file name.
- Group velocity is calculated from analytical derivative of dynamical matrix.
- Group velocities at degenerate phonon modes are better handled. This improves
  the accuracy of group velocity and thus for thermal conductivity.
- Re-implementation of third-order force constants calculation from supercell
  forces, which makes the calculation much faster
- When any phonon of triplets can be on the Brillouin zone boundary, i.e., when
  a mesh number is an even number, it is more carefully treated.

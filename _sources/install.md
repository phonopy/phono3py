# Installation

The detailed installation processes for different environments are described
below. The easiest installation with a good computation performance is achieved
by using the phono3py conda package. Installation of phonopy before the
installation of phono3py is required. See how to install phonopy at
https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html. Phono3py relies on phonopy, so
please use the latest release of phonopy when installing phono3py.

## Installation using conda

Using conda is the easiest way for installation of phono3py for linux and macOS.
These packages are made and maintained by Jan Janssen. The installation is
simply done by:

```bash
% conda install -c conda-forge phono3py
```

All dependent packages should be installed.

(install_from_source_code)=
## Installation from source code

When installing phono3py from the source code, a few libraries are required
before running `pip install`.

Note that at version 3.3.0, the build system of phono3py was modernized.
Nanobind, cmake, and scikit-build-core are used for the building. The receipt is
written in `CMakeLists.txt` and `pyproject.toml`. The old `setup.py` was
removed.

If phono3py is compiled with a special compiler or special options, manual
modification of `CMakeLists.txt` may be needed.

- {ref}`Linear algebra library <install_lapacke>`: BLAS, LAPACK, and LAPACKE
- {ref}`OpenMP library <install_openmp>`: For the multithreding support.

These packages may be installed by the package manager of OS (e.g. `apt`) or
conda environment. Automatic search of required libraries and flags that are
already on the system is performed by cmake.

(install_with_cmake)=
### Building with automatic search of library configurations by cmake

With installed cmake and required libraries on the system, cmake tries to find
libraries to be linked and the compiler flags that are required during the build.
This phono3py build can be launched by
```
% pip install -e . -vvv
```
See an example at {ref}`install_an_example`. In the standard output, flags and
libraries found by cmake are shown. Please carefully check if those
configurations are expected ones or not.

### Building without linking LAPACKE

**Experimental**

To compile phono3py without linking LAPACKE in C, use the following command:

```
% BUILD_WITHOUT_LAPACKE=ON pip install -e . -vvv
```

When this option is enabled, linking to BLAS and LAPACKE libraries is not
required, so installing these libraries for C compilation may not be necessary.
However, since numpy and scipy rely on BLAS and LAPACK libraries, their runtime
versions are still required.

## Installation instruction of latest development version of phono3py

When using conda, `PYTHONPATH` should not be set if possible because potentially
wrong python libraries can be imported.

1. Download miniforge

   Miniforge is downloaded at https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge. The
   detailed installation instruction is found in the same page. If usual conda
   or miniconda is used, the following `~/.condarc` setting is recommended:

   ```
   channel_priority: strict
   channels:
   - conda-forge
   ```

2. Initialization of conda and setup of conda environment

   ```bash
   % conda init <your_shell>
   ```

   `<your_shell>` is often `bash` but may be something else. It is important
   that after running `conda init`, your shell is needed to be closed and
   restarted. See more information by `conda init --help`.

   Then conda allows to make conda installation isolated by using conda's
   virtual environment.

   ```bash
   % conda create -n phono3py python
   % conda activate phono3py
   ```

3. Install necessary conda packages for phono3py

   For x86-64 system:

   ```bash
   % conda install numpy scipy h5py pyyaml matplotlib-base c-compiler cxx-compiler "libblas=*=*mkl" spglib mkl-include cmake
   ```

   A libblas library can be chosen among `[openblas, mkl, blis, netlib]`. If
   specific one is expected, it is installed by (e.g. openblas)

   ```bash
   % conda install "libblas=*=*openblas"
   ```

   For macOS ARM64 system, currently only openblas can be chosen:

   ```bash
   % conda install numpy scipy h5py pyyaml matplotlib-base c-compiler cxx-compiler spglib cmake openblas
   ```

   Note that using hdf5 files on NFS mounted file system, you may have to disable
   file locking by setting

   ```bash
   export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
   ```

   Install the latest phonopy and phono3py from github sources:

   ```bash
   % mkdir dev
   % cd dev
   % git clone https://github.com/phonopy/phonopy.git
   % git clone https://github.com/phonopy/phono3py.git
   % cd phonopy
   % pip install -e . -vvv
   % cd ../phono3py
   % pip install . -vvv
   ```

   The editable install (`pip install -e`) may not work depending on the
   computer environment. The conda packages dependency can often change and this
   recipe may not work properly. So if you find this instruction doesn't work,
   it is very appreciated if letting us know it in the phonopy mailing list.

(install_lapacke)=
## Installation of LAPACKE

LAPACK library is used in a few parts of the code to diagonalize matrices.
LAPACK*E* is the C-wrapper of LAPACK and LAPACK relies on BLAS. Both
single-thread or multithread BLAS can be used in phono3py. In the following,
multiple different ways of installation of LAPACKE are explained.

### OpenBLAS provided by conda

The installation of LAPACKE is easy by conda. It is:

```bash
% conda install -c conda-forge openblas
```

### Netlib LAPACKE provided by Ubuntu package manager (with single-thread BLAS)

LAPACKE (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) can be installed from the
Ubuntu package manager (`liblapacke` and `liblapacke-dev`):

```bash
% sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev
```

(install_openmp)=
## Multithreading and its controlling by C macro

Phono3py uses multithreading concurrency in two ways. One is that written in the
code with OpenMP `parallel for`. The other is achieved by using multithreaded
BLAS. The BLAS multithreading is depending on which BLAS library is chosen by
users and the number of threads to be used may be controlled by the library's
environment variables (e.g., `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` or `MKL_NUM_THREADS`). In
the phono3py C code, these two are written in a nested way, but of course the
nested use of multiple multithreadings has to be avoided. The outer loop of the
nesting is done by the OpenMP `parallel for` code. The inner loop calls LAPACKE
functions and then the LAPACKE functions call the BLAS routines. If both of the
inner and outer multithreadings can be activated, the inner multithreading must
be deactivated at the compilation time. This is achieved by setting the C macro
`MULTITHREADED_BLAS`, which can be written in `CMakeLists.txt`. Deactivating the
multithreading of BLAS using the environment variables is not recommended
because it is also used in the non-nested parts of the code and these
multithreadings are unnecessary to be deactivated.

### OpenMP library of gcc

With system provided gcc, `libgomp1` may be necessary to enable OpenMP
multithreading support. This library is probably installed already in your
system. If you don't have it and you use Ubuntu linux, it is installed by:

```bash
% sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

## Trouble shooting

1. Phonopy version should be the latest to use the latest phono3py.
2. There are other pitfalls, see
   https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/install.html#trouble-shooting.

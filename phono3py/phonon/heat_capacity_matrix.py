    r"""Calculate mode heat capacity matrix, Cqjj'.

    Note
    ----
    Diagonal (j=j') terms reduce to normal mode heat capacity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    temp : float
        Temperature in K.
    freqs : ndarray
        Phonon frequencies at a q-point in eV.
    cutoff : float
        This is used to check the degeneracy.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Heat capacity matrix in eV/K.

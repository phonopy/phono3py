    "phono3py_yaml"-like file is parsed unless crystal structure information is
    given by unitcell_filename, supercell_filename, unitcell
    (PhonopyAtoms-like), or supercell (PhonopyAtoms-like). Even when
    "phono3py_yaml"-like file is parse, parameters except for crystal structure
    can be overwritten.

    'fc3.hdf5' is read if found in current directory. Unless 'fc3.hdf5' is found
    and if 'FORCES_FC3' and 'phono3py_disp.yaml" are found, these are read and
    fc3 and fc2 are produced.

    if 'fc2.hdf5' is found, this is read. Unless 'fc2.hdf5' is found and if
    'FORCES_FC2' and 'phono3py_disp.yaml" are found, these are read and fc2 is
    produced.

    When force_sets_filename and force_constants_filename are not given,
    'FORCES_FC3' and 'FORCES_FC2' are looked for in the current directory as the
    default behavior. When 'FORCES_FC3' ('FORCES_FC2') is given in the type-1
    format, 'phono3py_disp.yaml' is also necessary and read.

    Crystal structure
    -----------------
    Means to provide crystal structure(s) and their priority:
        1. unitcell_filename (with supercell_matrix)
        2. supercell_filename
        3. unitcell (with supercell_matrix)
        4. supercell.
        5. phono3py_yaml-like

    Force sets or force constants
    -----------------------------
    Optional. Means to provide information to generate force constants and their
    priority:
        1. fc3_filename (fc2_filename)
        2. forces_fc3_filename (forces_fc2_filename). Do not forget that for
           type-1 format, phono3py_disp.yaml has to be given, too.
        3. 'fc3.hdf5' and 'fc2.hdf5' are searched in current directory.
        4. 'FORCES_FC3' and 'FORCES_FC2' are searched in current directory.
           'FORCES_FC2' is optional. For type-1 format, 'phono3py_disp.yaml' is
           also searched in current directory. When 'FORCES_FC2' is not found,
           'FORCES_FC3' is used to create fc2.

    Parameters for non-analytical term correction (NAC)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Optional. Means to provide NAC parameters and their priority:
        1. born_filename
        2. nac_params
        3. phono3py_yaml_like.nac_params if existed and is_nac=True.
        4. 'BORN' is searched in current directory when is_nac=True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phono3py_yaml : str, optional
        Filename of "phono3py.yaml"-like file. If this is given, the data in the
        file are parsed. Default is None.
    supercell_matrix : array_like, optional
        Supercell matrix multiplied to input cell basis vectors. shape=(3, ) or
        (3, 3), where the former is considered a diagonal matrix. Default is the
        unit matrix. dtype=int
    primitive_matrix : array_like or str, optional
        Primitive matrix multiplied to input cell basis vectors. Default is the
        identity matrix. When given as array_like, shape=(3, 3), dtype=float.
        When 'F', 'I', 'A', 'C', or 'R' is given instead of a 3x3 matrix, the
        primitive matrix defined at
        https://spglib.github.io/spglib/definition.html is used. When 'auto' is
        given, the centring type ('F', 'I', 'A', 'C', 'R', or primitive 'P') is
        automatically chosen. Default is 'auto'.
    phonon_supercell_matrix : array_like, optional
        Supercell matrix used for fc2. In phono3py, supercell matrix for fc3
        and fc2 can be different to support longer range interaction of fc2 than
        that of fc3. Unless setting this, supercell_matrix is used. This is only
        valid when unitcell or unitcell_filename is given. Default is None.
    is_nac : bool, optional
        If True, look for 'BORN' file. If False, NAS is turned off. Default is
        True.
    calculator : str, optional.
        Calculator used for computing forces. This is used to switch the set of
        physical units when parsing calculator input/output files. Default is
        None, which is equivalent to "vasp".
    unitcell : PhonopyAtoms, optional
        Input unit cell. Default is None.
    supercell : PhonopyAtoms, optional
        Input supercell. With given, default value of primitive_matrix is set to
        'auto' (can be overwritten). supercell_matrix is ignored. Default is
        None.
    nac_params : dict, optional
        Parameters required for non-analytical term correction. Default is None.
        {'born': Born effective charges
                 (array_like, shape=(primitive cell atoms, 3, 3), dtype=float),
         'dielectric': Dielectric constant matrix
                       (array_like, shape=(3, 3), dtype=float),
         'factor': unit conversion factor (float)}
    unitcell_filename : os.PathLike, optional
        Input unit cell filename. Default is None.
    supercell_filename : os.PathLike, optional
        Input supercell filename. When this is specified, supercell_matrix is
        ignored. Default is None.
    born_filename : os.PathLike, optional
        Filename corresponding to 'BORN', a file contains non-analytical term
        correction parameters.
    forces_fc3_filename : sequence or os.PathLike, optional
        A two-elemental sequence of filenames corresponding to ('FORCES_FC3',
        'phono3py_disp.yaml') in the type-1 format or a filename (os.PathLike)
        corresponding to 'FORCES_FC3' in the type-2 format. Default is None.
    forces_fc2_filename : os.PathLike or sequence, optional
        A two-elemental sequence of filenames corresponding to ('FORCES_FC2',
        'phono3py_disp.yaml') in the type-1 format or a filename (os.PathLike)
        corresponding to 'FORCES_FC2' in the type-2 format. Default is None.
    fc3_filename : os.PathLike, optional
        Filename of a file corresponding to 'fc3.hdf5', a file contains
        third-order force constants. Default is None.
    fc2_filename : os.PathLike, optional
        Filename of a file corresponding to 'fc2.hdf5', a file contains
        second-order force constants. Default is None.
    fc_calculator : str, optional
        Force constants calculator. Currently only 'alm'. Default is None.
    fc_calculator_options : str, optional
        Optional parameters that are passed to the external fc-calculator. This
        is given as one text string. How to parse this depends on the
        fc-calculator. For alm, each parameter is split by comma ',', and
        each set of key and value pair is written in 'key = value'.
    factor : float, optional
        Phonon frequency unit conversion factor. Unless specified, default unit
        conversion factor for each calculator is used.
    produce_fc : bool, optional
        Setting False, force constants are not calculated from displacements and

        Setting False, force constants are not symmetrized when creating force
        constants from displacements and forces. Default is True.
    is_mesh_symmetry : bool, optional
        Setting False, reciprocal mesh symmetry is not considered. Default is
        True.
    is_compact_fc : bool, optional
        fc3 are created in the array whose shape is
            True: (primitive, supercell, supercell, 3, 3, 3) False: (supercell,

        and for fc2
            True: (primitive, supercell, 3, 3) False: (supercell, supercell, 3, 3)
        where 'supercell' and 'primitive' indicate number of atoms in these
        cells. Default is False.
    use_pypolymlp : bool, optional
        Use pypolymlp for generating force constants. Default is False.
    mlp_params : dict, optional

        fc3 transformation from real to reciprocal space is done around three
        atoms and averaged when True. Default is False, i.e., only around the
        first atom. Setting False is for rough compatibility with v2.x. Default
        is True.
